# Tabular-OCR


**OCR (Optical Character Recognition):**

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that enables the conversion of text contained within images or scanned documents into machine-readable text.
It involves analyzing the shapes and patterns of characters within an image to recognize and extract the text content, making it available for further processing and analysis.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, OCR technology is employed to extract textual information from images. 
The project workflow includes applying image processing techniques to enhance the image quality, selecting Regions of Interest (ROI) within the images to focus on specific areas, and finally, appending the extracted text data into a list for further use or analysis.
